## Lesson 4: Integrate and use the custom worker in AEMaaCS

When the custom workers are done, you could deploy it onto I/O Runtime serverless platform to make it ready for integration in AEMaaCS. Execute the command `aio app deploy`, which will output all the endpoints of your custom workers in this format `https://1234-projectA-workspaceB.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/example-custom-worker-0.0.1/worker-name`.

Next, in AEMaaCS, go to `Tools -> Assets -> Processing Profiles` to create a new processing profile. Give it a name, then under the Custom tab, configure the processing service to map the custom worker endpoints to corresponding renditions.

After saving the new profile, you need to apply it to a DAM folder.

Finally, you can test your custom workers by uploading any image to the applied folder. It would take a few seconds for the image processing, then you can see the new renditions including the "cutout" generated by the custom worker.
